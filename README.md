Modpack Version Number Guide:

In a modpack's version number, each digit carries specific meaning and helps you understand what to expect from the modpack. The version number is typically formatted as X.Y.Z.A, where:

1. The First Number (X): Main Version
   - This is the primary identifier of the modpack's major release.
   - Changes to the main version often indicate significant updates, new content, or major reworks.
   - A higher main version number suggests a more substantial change.

2. The Second Number (Y): Modpack Type
   - The second digit designates the type or variant of the modpack.
   - 0 typically represents the "Standard" version, offering the core gameplay experience.
   - 1 may indicate a variant with "More Render Distance" for improved visuals and exploration.

3. The Third Number (Z): Graphical Settings
   - The third digit reflects the preset graphical settings of the modpack.
   - A lower number suggests lower graphical fidelity and better performance on modest systems.
   - A higher number implies higher graphical settings, potentially delivering stunning visuals but requiring more powerful hardware.

4. The Fourth Number (A): Minor Updates and Bug Fixes
   - The fourth digit accounts for minor updates, bug fixes, and patches.
   - It may range from 1 to 3 numbers long to indicate the level of minor changes.
   - These updates often address issues, improve stability, and enhance the overall experience.

Understanding these version numbers will help you choose the right modpack to suit your preferences and hardware capabilities. Whether you're looking for the latest content, enhanced visuals, or optimal performance, the version number provides valuable insight into what you can expect from the modpack.
